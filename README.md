# Hand_written_digits-classification

Here I implemented mnist data classifier using artificial neural networks from the scratch without using tensorflow.

I used 3 layer neural network in which middle layer consists of 30 nodes.

The activation function I used here is sigmoid function.

To get an  insight about sigmoid function:
 please go through the link:

Before running the code,make sure that you have the mlxtend module which is used to load the dataset.
